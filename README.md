# Regsahs-DataStructure-Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of (currently) two fundamental data structures: Linked List and Stack.

## Linked List (LinkedList.h)

The `LinkedList` class is a versatile linked list implementation that provides dynamic storage for a sequence of elements. It offers operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements efficiently. 
The Linked List supports different constructors and methods, including resizing, reversing, and more.

## Stack (Stack.h)

The `Stack` class implements a stack data structure using a singly linked list. It supports standard stack operations like push, pop, and top.

## Queue (Queue.h)

The `Queue` class implements a queue data structure using a singly linked list. It provides methods for enqueueing, dequeueing, checking the front element and more.

## Heap (Heap.h)

The `Heap` class implements a heap data structure, supporting both max heap and min heap. It includes operations for pushing, popping, and accessing elements, as well as heapify operations.

## Dynamic Array (List.h)

The `List` class is a dynamic array implementation that provides dynamic storage for a sequence of elements. It offers operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements efficiently. The List supports different constructors like a std::initializer_list<T> constructor and various methods such as a resize method.

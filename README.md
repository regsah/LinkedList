# Regsahs-DataStructure-Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of (currently) two fundamental data structures: Linked List and Stack.

## Linked List (LinkedList.h)

The `LinkedList` class is a versatile linked list implementation that provides dynamic storage for a sequence of elements. It offers operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements efficiently. 
The Linked List supports different constructors and methods, including resizing, reversing, and more.

## Stack (Stack.h)
The `Stack` class implements a stack data structure using a singly linked list. It supports standard stack operations like push, pop, and top.
